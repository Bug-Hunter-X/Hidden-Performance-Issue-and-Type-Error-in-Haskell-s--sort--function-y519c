```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code looks innocuous, but it hides a potential performance problem. The `sort` function from `Data.List` uses mergesort, which has a time complexity of O(n log n).  While this is generally efficient, for very large lists, the performance can degrade.  This is especially true if the list is nearly sorted already. In those cases, an insertion sort (O(n^2) worst case, but O(n) in nearly sorted cases) might be faster.  The issue is not readily apparent without profiling and benchmarking the code with large datasets.

Another issue, is that if the list `xs` contains elements that aren't comparable (e.g., a mix of `Int` and `String` elements), the `sort` function will fail at runtime with a rather unhelpful error message.
